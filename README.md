This was my firs time using Unity. Adter this, I started doing game jams with my friend. I make the music, we both make the art, and we both work on the code/Unity interface. 

GameJams
We have done 2 gamejams. The first game jam was a 2d side scroller where we experimented with a lot of player movement and collectables. We got second place out of 15 submissions.

In our second game jam, we made a 2d top down game, where we worked with usable items and story building. We were able to finish all the art and music, but we didnt finish the code because my partner had an emergency and couldnt continue. The game is close to complete but some of the finishing game mechanics could not be finished.

Projects
I am currently working on two projects. 

My priority is making a 2d fighting game inspired by guilty gear. This one has gotten past the basics and is onto art, abilities, and character design. I am trying to learn how to balance frame data. I have already made the multiplayer asspect, movement, and borders.

My low priority project is an io game called King of the Hill. There is a base in the middle that a team wants to occupy. Players start in safe zones on the edge of the maps, and as they get closer to the middle, they can get better loot. In the middle, people can kill to get their stuff. You can only collect materials if you have a base. Your base can store materials, so if you die, it wont be lost. If you want to move your base closer to the middle, for better stuff, you will have to hold all your matrerials, making you vulnerable.
